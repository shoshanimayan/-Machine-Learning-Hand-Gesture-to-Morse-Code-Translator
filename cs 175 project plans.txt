Goal: assign labels to hand images that say whether the hand is an open fist (0),
closed fist(1), or it's ambiguous (2)

Rough Plan:
-first find out which xy coordinates correspond with which joint
-test with a few select images and see if you can figure out a formula/pattern from the coordinates for
recognizing which label to assign
-most likely gonna compare the distance between the base of each finger compared to the tip
